# PCS Database

This repository is for a database of PCS (Personal Comfort System) such as a desk fan and foot warmer. 
Each PCS cooling/heating effects on the human body was quantified using a thermal manikin in a climate controlled chamber
at the IEQLab of The University of Sydney.

The repository contains the data and the related code to generate database as the following file structure.
Please note that all the image files are not stored in this repository due to the limited storage of this repository,
but you can access them at [here](https://unisyd-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/akihisa_nomoto_sydney_edu_au/Documents/PCS%20Database?csf=1&web=1&e=QgKj7a) upon request.

We also offer a simple web application for this database, which you can access at https://pcs-database.onrender.com. 
(Please note that we may change the hosting service in the future.)

Each time you start using our service, it may take up to a minute to wake up—just like a sleeping koala 🐨🐨🐨. 
This is a characteristic of the free hosting service we currently use, which puts applications to sleep when there is no traffic.
